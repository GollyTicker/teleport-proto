# teleport-proto
##### A Sandbox / Simulation of a visualization-oriented and similarity-based Teleportation Mechanic

The project is a prototype. Current status:
  1. Definition of state-space and similarity measure (100%)
  2. Definition of probability distribution / probability particles over state-space (50%, particles done)
  3. Rendering / Animation of the probability distribution (0%)
  4. Distribution Dynamics (including effects of visualization) (0%)
  5. Player control and visualization input (0%)
  6. ~ Playing around and experimenting ~
